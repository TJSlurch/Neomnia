My submission for the 2024 Bath University GameJam!

For the theme "Colour Changes Everything", I wanted to create a 2D platformer where the player can change colour to influence gameplay. Upon touching a coloured tile, the character changes slightly.
- White: Resets the player to normal
- Green: Jump height is increased
- Blue: Run speed is increased
- Orange: Walls can be climbed
- Pink: Causes other tiles to move
- Yellow: The player is able to dash horizontally
- Red: Resets the player to the previous checkpoint

Player Animations are from: https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero. Other assets, sound effects and music were created by me.
